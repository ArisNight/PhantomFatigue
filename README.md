# PhantomFatigue
A server-side mod that removes annoying Phantom spawn from the game, added in version 1.13. Instead of ghost spawn, the effects of fatigue and deceleration of level 2 will be applied to the player if he has not slept for 3 nights, which looks more realistic. Similar to how we do in life, we don't sleep a lot of the time, we feel tired.

### Planned:
- Adding a command to turn off effects individually.
- Adding support for the LuckPerms rights allocation mod
